			<h3>WARNING!</h3>
		    
			<p>The systems and markets that I'm showing you
			    today are bleeding edge and <strong>incredibly
			    unstable</strong>. Everything could collapse
			    tomorrow in
			    bizarre ways that are impossible to predict.</p>

			<p><strong>I am not a financial advisor</strong> and
			    none of my advice should be used for investment
			    purposes. You should assume that speculating in
			    cryptocurrencies is like <strong>gambling in a casino</strong>.

		    <h3>What I <em>Believe</em> About The Blockchain Ecosystem</h3>
		    <ul>
			<li>It is the future of <strong>assigning,
			    storing and transferring value</strong></li>
			<li>It's a <strong>huge</strong> and will have
			    a <strong>profound impact</strong> on the digital world.</li>
		    </ul>
		    <aside class="notes">
			<p>These are very grandiose statements, I know but
			    I believe they're true</p>
			<p>It's the biggest thing to happen to money
			    since the invention of currency</p>
			<p>This is why I'm trying to learn a little
			    about the blockchain this year</p>
		    </aside>
		</section>
		<section>
		    <h3>How Should I Get Started?</h3>
		    <ul>
			<li>To start your learning process <strong>you need to start making transactions</strong>.</li>
			<li>We'll be working in the <strong>Ethereum ecosystem</strong>
			because of it's popularity and low transaction
			costs.</li>
		    </ul>
		    <aside class="notes">
			<ul>
			    <li>I'm an experiential learner.</li>
			    <li>I'm consistently amazed by people who
			    claim to be blockchain experts who've
				never made a single transaction.</li>
			</ul>

			    My big mistake with learning about the
			    blockchain was that I thought I had to

			    my first nickel.

		    <p>But "real" money is also very complicated</p>
		    <aside class="notes">
			<p>
			    Most people have no idea how any of these things work:
			    <ul>
				<li>Credit card transactions</li>
				<li>Mutual funds</li>
				<li>ACH transactions</li>
				<li>Wire transfers</li>
				<li>How the fed controls the supply of currency.</li>
			    </ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			    You certainly wouldn't try to teach a
			child about all of these things before you let
			them buy their first candy bar.</p>

			<p>But you need to learn how money works at a
			young age. And chances are you need or want to
			    learn how this whole blockchain thing works.</p>
			<p>
			    It dawned on me that the way that we teach
			    kids about using money is a good model
			    for teaching adults (or kids) how to use
			    cryptocurrencies.

		    <p>Which childhood financial lessons should we use
			when starting with the blockchain?</p>
		</section>
		<section>
		    <h3>Principle #1</h3>
		    <p>Find a sherpa who will help you along the way.</p>
		    <aside class="notes">
			<p>When I was a kid this was an older siblling or parent.</p>
			<p>See if you have a crypto-savvy friend. If not, make one at a user group!</p>
		    </aside>
		</section>
		<section>
		    <h3>Principle #2</h3>
		    <p>Find a trustworthy source of "money"</p>
		    <img src="images/coinbase-logo.png" />
		    <aside class="notes">
			<p>When I was a kid I trusted that the coins I
			got were real and that I could buy things with
			    them.</p>
			<p>With cryptocurrencies you have two choices:
			    <ul>
				<li>A reputable exchange like Coinbase.</li>
				<li>A friend who will give or sell you
				some cryptocurrency.</li>
			    </ul>
			</p>
		    </aside>
		</section>
		<section>
		    <h3>Principle #3</h3>
		    <p>Find a trustworthy wallet app</p>
		    <img src="images/coinbase-logo.png" />
		    <img src="images/metamask-logo.png" width="25%" height="25%" />
		    <img src="images/trustwallet-logo.png" width="20%" height="20%" />
		    <aside class="notes">
			<p>Coinbase is a good web wallet. The
			disadvantage is that you don't control your
			    private keys.</p>
			<p>Metamask is my favorite desktop wallet
			    because it's easy to use and open-source.</p>
			<p>Trustwallet is a good mobile option that's
			also open source and very easy to use.</p>
		    </aside>
		</section>
		<section>
		    <h3>Principle #4</h3>
		    <p>Start with small sums of money in your wallet.</p>
		    <aside class="notes">
			<p>To quote Sinbad, you didn't give a kid a
			    dollar when he was little because they would
			    OD on penny candy.</p>
			<p>I started with $40 at first because that
			    was the amount I would have paid for a good
			    book</p>
			<p>Find a currency with relatively low
			    transactions costs and buy a small amount
			    using a reputable exchange.</p>
			<p>Treat this like small-scale gambling.
			    <ul>
				<li>But more fun!</li>
				<li>It's still cheaper than most books and classes.</li>
			    </ul>
			</p>
		    </aside>
		</section>
		<section>
		    <h3>Principle #5</h3>
		    <p>Make small, simple transactions.</p>
		    <img src="images/bazooka-joe.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"/>
		    <img src="images/cryptokitty.png" width="30%" height="30%"/>
		    <aside class="notes">
			<p>When I was a kid I started by buying
			    bazooka joe and candy bars.</p>
			<p>Good examples for cryptocurrency transactions:
			    <ul>
				<li>Send a few bucks to your buddy and have him/her send it back.</li>
				<ul>
				    <li>I kid you not, this is like MAGIC</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Donate a buck to the internet archive!</li>
				<li>Buy a Cryptokitty!</li>
			</p>

		    <h3>Principle #6</h3>
		    <p>Expect to lose money in suprising ways!</p>

			<p>When I was a kid I lost "all" of my money 20 different ways.</p>
		    </aside>

		<section>
		    <h3>Ways to lose cryptocurrency:</h3>
		    <ul>
			<li>Somehow losing your wallet</li>
			<li>Transaction fees</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>
			The key here is to create a "risk sandbox"
		    where mistakes can be made without dire
		    consequences.</p>
		    <aside class="notes">
			<li>Somehow losing your wallet</li>
			<ul>
			    <li>Oh no, I wasn't supposed to share that online?</li>
			    <li>Oh no, I was supposed to back that up?</li>
			    <li>Share your story of how you thought you lost $270 of bitcoin.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Transaction fees</li>
			<ul>
			    <li>This happens to all of us.</li>
			    <li>You're having fun and then notice that you no longer have enough money to move $0.05 when you want to move $5.00.</li>
